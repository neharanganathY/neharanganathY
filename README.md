### ✍️ Writing & Learning on Medium

I'm a lifelong learner who loves to break down technical concepts in a human, relatable way. Whether it's understanding how AI connects with C#, or demystifying Azure for beginners, I believe that documenting your learning is just as powerful as the learning itself.

On my [**Medium blog**]((https://medium.com/@nehary24)), I’ll be sharing:
- My approach to building real-world .NET + React projects
- Insights from my AZ-900 and AI certification prep
- Tiny lessons from solving bugs, building components, or using tools like Postman and Swagger
- Creative tech twists like story-driven coding and kid-friendly animation ideas

🌱 I write to remember, to connect, and to help someone like me just a few months ago.
