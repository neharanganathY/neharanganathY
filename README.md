### ✍️ Writing & Learning on Medium

I'm a lifelong learner who loves to break down technical concepts in a human, relatable way. Whether it’s understanding how AI connects with C#, or demystifying Azure for beginners, I believe **sharing your learning is just as powerful as the learning itself.**

📚 On my [**Medium blog**](https://medium.com/@nehary24), I’ll be sharing:
- My approach to building real-world .NET + React projects  
- Tiny lessons from solving bugs, building components, or working with tools like Swagger/Postman  
- Creative coding adventures and kid-friendly features I sneak into my work
